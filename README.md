# Piano

Live version: https://margokrk.github.io/Piano/

An aplication created in React to play the virtual piano using computer mouse or keybord keys.
Signature buttons can show us notes (C3-B5), keybord keys or clear piano keys. We can also change volume using the volume slider.
The Record button is used to record the melody, and when we finish play, we can save it with the title or reject it.
When we save the melody, the title will appear in the Select section. Next to Select section we have Play and Trash buttons, so we can play our song or delete it.
